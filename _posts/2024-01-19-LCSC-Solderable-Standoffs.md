# Solderable standoffs on LCSC

Want solderable standoffs from LCSC? They might not be easy to find. However, use the search term SMTSO and you will find a surprising number.

In addition, here's three categories that I've found them appear in:
[first](https://www.lcsc.com/products/SMD-round-nut_11790.html),
[second](https://www.lcsc.com/products/SMT-hex-nut-post_11820.html),
[third](https://www.lcsc.com/products/Other-nuts_12808.html).

Also lmao look at these [threaded inserts](https://www.lcsc.com/products/Through-hole-insert-round-nuts_11803.html) that have no
datasheet or parameters listed, and use stock pictures. Me, I'm tempted to buy some just to see what they're like!

Hope this helps. Cheers!

As usual, for any notes, contact me somehow and let me know.
