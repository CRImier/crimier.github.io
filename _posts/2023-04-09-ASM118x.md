# ASM1182/ASM1184/ASM1187 chip notes

![](/assets/img/230409_asm118x/0.jpg)

These are cool cheapish PCIe switches, 1 to 2/4/7 links accordingly. They're used in many places, from mining equipment to desktop motherboards.
I describe them a bit [in a Hackaday article](https://hackaday.com/2023/03/30/pcie-for-hackers-extracting-the-most/).
There is not much documentation on them - I wanna aggregate whatever is available, on a single page.

They all seem to need a 1.2V source. No idea how much current tho.

KiCad package for the ASM1184 is Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-64-1EP_9x9mm_P0.5mm_EP5.2x5.2mm. 

None of them have datasheets that I've seen - things like the I2C registers remain a mystery. Got one? Please let me know!

Info about ASM1182:

- This [laptop schematic PDF](http://s472165864.onlinehome.fr/anyware/manuels/P75xZM_ESM.pdf). It also has some info on strap pins!

Info about ASM1184:

- This [schematic PDF](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/enterprise/developerbox/hardware-docs/mzsc2am_v03_20180115_a.pdf)
- This [blog post](https://will127534.github.io/CM4-Nvme-NAS/) - the [associated GitHub repo](https://github.com/will127534/CM4-Nvme-NAS) also has KiCad files!!
- Also, from the aforementioned blog post - apparently, there's an EasyEDA symbol for this chip?

Info about ASM1187:

- A [desktop motherboard boardview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wIRpNwNUFoA7Ap0dAE8z4ykdmxrnNnUv/view?usp=drivesdk)

All of them, you can find on Aliexpress.

What we could use:

- Datasheets
- I2C register maps

Got more info? Contact me through one of the ways you can find.
